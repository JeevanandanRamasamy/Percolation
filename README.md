Percolation is an abstract model for many physical systems. Given a n-by-n grid of sites, each site is open with probability p, the system percolates if and only if any open site in the top row in the grid is connected to any open site in the bottom row by open sites.

## Solution

Found whether the water percolates using Weighted Quick Union and a 2-D array structure in n-squared time complexity.
